# DotaApiManage

This is a small project desgined to call and store information from the Dota 2 Api

The project calls multiple Api's to collect match history for a player, the match details for each of the given games, and also the hero information to determine which heros were played in a match

At the current state there are only a small number of functions built to retrieve information from the parsed json, however the can be easliy implemented in the future.
